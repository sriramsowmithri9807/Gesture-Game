# Gesture Game 🎮✋  

**Play the Chrome Dino game hands-free!**  
Gesture Game is an innovative project that lets you control the Chrome Dino game using real-time hand gestures. Leveraging the power of **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **PyAutoGUI**, this project detects hand gestures through a webcam and simulates a spacebar press, making the Dino jump.
